Direct Economic Damage
**********************

The **Direct Economic Damage** window allows you to asses the direct economic damage expected for the structures and for the content of the property at risk.

The figure shows the interface for the calculation

Since the plug-in allows you to have different **instances** of both **hazard** and **exposure**, each calculation must refer to a combination of them, which we call **scenario**.
For example the **scenario** of the current situation, named **"SCENARIO 0"** is the combination of the **"instance 0"** of the **hazard** with the **"instance 0"** of the exposure.
The scenario is also completely defined by the choice also of the **type of vulnerability curves** to be adopted for the calculation.

Since for each hazard there are data for different **return periods**, the plug-in recursively performs the calculation for each **return period**.
In the lower part of the interface it is possible to individually choose the **return period** results to be displayed on the map.

Ultimately, having chosen a SCENARIO, the data used are the following:
	
#. Data concern **assets at risk** and their **vulnerability** (depth-damage curves) are stored in the geodatabase. 
#. Data concern the **hazard** are a map of **maximum depth** values due to flooding (one for each return period).
   These data are the output from a 2D hydraulic model and are loaded into the system from any file type **GDAL Raster Formats**
#. The database can contain different types of depth-damage curves: before performing the calculation you must choose from those available and you can view the **Charts**.
#. Results are maps of **damage** and **vulnerability** to residential, commercial and industrial property and a **global summary table** of the results which are also displayed in graphical form (histogram).

.. note:: **Layers** of results for each **return period**.

   :Economic Damage Layer *(*_dmg.tif)*: 
       a *GeoTIFF File Format* having two output *bands*:
	   
	   :band1: *economic damage* expected for the structures (Euro per square meter)
	   :band2: *economic damage* expected for the contents   (Euro per square meter)
	   
   :Vulnerability Layer *(*_vuln.tif)*:
       a *GeoTIFF File Format* having two output *bands*:
	   
	   :band1: *vulnerability* for the structures (% of damage)
	   :band2: *vulnerability* for the contents   (% of damage)

   :Global summary table *(*_dmg.csv)*: 
       a *csv File Format* containing the table of results grouped by *class of asset*
